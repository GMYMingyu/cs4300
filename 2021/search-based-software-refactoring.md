---

In this lecture, we will discuss two papers:

* M. O'Keeffe, and M. Ó Cinnéide, "Search-based refactoring for software maintenance," The Journal of Systems and Software, vol. 81, no. 4, pp. 502-516, April 2008.
* C. Schröder, A. vd Feltz, A. Panichella, M. Aniche. Search-Based Software Re-Modularization: A Case Study at Adyen, Proceedings of IEEE/ACM 43rd International Conference on Software Engineering: Software Engineering in Practice (ICSE-SEIP), 2021.

Although not compulsory, I also recommend the following papers:

* Kim, J., Batory, D., Dig, D., & Azanza, M. (2016, May). Improving refactoring speed by 10x. In Proceedings of the 38th International Conference on Software Engineering (pp. 1145-1156).
* M. Harman, and L. Tratt, "Pareto Optimal Search Based Refactoring at the Design Level," 9th Annual Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO'07), pp. 1106-1113, 2007.
* Bavota, Gabriele, Filomena Carnevale, Andrea De Lucia, Massimiliano Di Penta, and Rocco Oliveto. "Putting the developer in-the-loop: an interactive GA for software re-modularization." In International Symposium on Search Based Software Engineering, pp. 75-89. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, 2012.
