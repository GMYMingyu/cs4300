In this lecture, we will discuss two papers:

* Aniche, M., Maziero, E., Durelli, R., & Durelli, V. (2020). The Effectiveness of Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms in Predicting Software Refactoring. IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering.
* N. Tsantalis, and A. Chatzigeorgiou, "Identification of Move Method Refactoring Opportunities," IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, vol. 35, no. 3, pp. 347-367, May/June 2009.


Although not compulsory, I also recommend the following papers:

* G. Bavota, A. De Lucia, and R. Oliveto, "Identifying Extract Class Refactoring Opportunities Using Structural and Semantic Cohesion Measures," The Journal of Systems and Software, vol. 84, no. 3, pp. 397-414, March 2011.
* H. Liu, Z. Niu, Z. Ma, and W. Shao, "Identification of Generalization Refactoring Opportunities," Automated Software Engineering, 2012.
* Danilo Silva, Ricardo Terra, and Marco Tulio Valente, "Recommending Automated Extract Method Refactorings," 22nd International Conference on Program Comprehension (ICPC'14), Hyderabad, India, June 2-3, 2014
* Ricardo Terra, Marco Tulio Valente, Sergio Miranda, Vitor Sales. JMove: A Novel Heuristic and Tool to Detect Move Method Refactoring Opportunities. Journal of Systems and Software, vol. 138, pages 19-36, 2018.
