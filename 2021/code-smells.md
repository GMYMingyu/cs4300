---

In this lecture, we will discuss two papers:

* Aniche, Maurício, Gabriele Bavota, Christoph Treude, Marco Aurélio Gerosa, and Arie van Deursen. "Code smells for model-view-controller architectures." Empirical Software Engineering 23, no. 4 (2018): 2121-2157.
* Sharma, T., Singh, P., & Spinellis, D. (2020). An empirical investigation on the relationship between design and architecture smells. Empirical Software Engineering, 25(5), 4020-4068.

Although not compulsory, I also recommend the following papers:

* Bavota, G., Dit, B., Oliveto, R., Di Penta, M., Poshyvanyk, D., & De Lucia, A. (2013, May). An empirical study on the developers' perception of software coupling. In 2013 35th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) (pp. 692-701). IEEE.
