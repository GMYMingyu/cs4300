In this lecture, we will discuss two papers:

* M. Kim, D. Cai, and S. Kim, "An empirical investigation into the role of API-level refactorings during software evolution," 33rd International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE'11), pp. 151â€“160, 2011.
* Ng, T. H., Shing Chi Cheung, Wing-Kwong Chan, and Yuen-Tak Yu. "Work experience versus refactoring to design patterns: a controlled experiment." In Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGSOFT international symposium on Foundations of software engineering, pp. 12-22. 2006.

Although not compulsory, I also recommend the following papers:

* Danilo Silva, Nikolaos Tsantalis, and Marco Tulio Valente, "Why We Refactor? Confessions of GitHub Contributors," 24th ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE'2016), Seattle, WA, USA, November 13-18, 2016.
